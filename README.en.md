# Chia Coin Calculator

This is a calculator specialized in Chia Coin, a cryptocurrency that uses a mining method known as "Proof of Space and Time". The calculator allows you to calculate how many Chia Coin plots can fit on a disk, as well as the optimal combination to maximize storage capacity and minimize energy consumption.

## Test It

## Features

- Calculates the number of Chia Coin plots that can fit on a disk.
- Provides the optimal combination to maximize storage capacity and minimize energy consumption.
- Takes into account the size of the disk, the storage capacity of each plot, energy consumption, and the energy efficiency of the available hard drives on the market.
- Helps to reduce energy consumption when mining Chia Coin.
- Easy to use and doesn't require advanced technical knowledge.

## Usage

To use this calculator, simply enter the data of the disk you want to use and the calculator will show you how many Chia Coin plots you can store on it. It will also give you the optimal combination to maximize storage capacity and minimize energy consumption.
